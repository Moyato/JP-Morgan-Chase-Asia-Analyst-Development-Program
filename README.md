### Data Transformation 
For task 1 created 3 outputs for quarterly financial overview, Customer trends, and annual projections. In task 2 created a Financial forecast for the team to make Investment decisions. Finally, different valuation methods in order to make investment decisions.

### Analysis
Looking at the financial metrics from the quarterly financial overview, we can see that the EBITA margin remains positive but end to have big drops in Q4. Net income margin also remains positive but also has huge drops in Q4 but bounces back in. The FCF per diluted share trends negatively in 2021 with Q4 being the lowest but trend positively upward while taking dips in Q2 2022 and Q4 2022. This shows the profitability of the company is increasing but is yet to stabilize. 

From its annual projections, the debt/EBITDA shows a that the company is healthy. The FCF per share shows an upward trend from 2022 showing the ability of the company to pay its debt, pay dividends and facilitate growth.

Customer trends shows a high churn rate in 2022 this is due to the price increase. This show elasticity of the price of eZBike.

The Cash conversion cycle (CCC) is high with it taking on average 6 months to convert cash spent on inventory and other resources to cash from sales.
Looking at investment analysis, an Investment 2 of a 5-year maturity offers a relatively safer choice. This is because it offers a relatively good return with a low risk without the need of reinvesting every year and the issue of money being locked up for a long time and unable to make cash payments.

### Conclusion and recommendation 
From the ccc, the company can be more efficient with its operations. Also, the company should refrain from making price changes to frequently due to the price elasticity. 

From the financial metrics we can see that the profitability of the company is there and the company is relatively healthy according to industry average, however, the company should refrain from making long term investment due to its low cash flow and cash profits.
